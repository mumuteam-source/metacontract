MCW-04 | No Limit on Transaction Pending period or Executable period

Minor
Modifiedï¼š
However, this strategy carries the risk that if any validOwner becomes unresponsive or disagrees with the pending transaction, it could obstruct the normal functioning of these functions. The team can establish a specific timeframe for how long transactions can remain pending.

We add an timeframe for 96 hours:

 uint256 public maxPendingTime = 96 hours;
 
After one pending tx have be created, no more tx can be created within this timeframe !
but if some validOwner do not agree and not sign with it, after the timeframe of 96 hours,
this pending tx will be deleted, and a new one could be created!
the function named deleteMaxPendingTx,which is added under all the functions like setWithdrawAddress, addowner and removeOwner.
this can check do it like below:

function  deleteMaxPendingTx()
    private 
    {
         require(_pendingTransactions.length <= 1,"has pending txs! Please sign them first");   
         
         if(_pendingTransactions.length == 1 ){
                uint txId = _pendingTransactions[0];
                Transaction storage pendingwithdrawTx = _transactions[txId];
                TxAddOwner storage pendingaddTx = _txaddowners[txId];
                TxDelOwner storage pendingdelTx = _txdelowners[txId];
                //for withdraw Txs
                if (pendingwithdrawTx.timestamp > 0 ){
                    if(block.timestamp - pendingwithdrawTx.timestamp > maxPendingTime){
                         deleteTransaction(txId);
                    } else revert("has pending txs yet! Please sign them first");
                   
                }
                //for add user Txs
                if (pendingaddTx.timestamp> 0 ){
                    if(block.timestamp - pendingaddTx.timestamp > maxPendingTime) {
                         deleteAddUserTx(txId);
                    }else revert("has pending txs yet! Please sign them first");
                   
                } 
                //for del user Txs
                if (pendingdelTx.timestamp > 0 ){
                    if (block.timestamp - pendingdelTx.timestamp > maxPendingTime){
                        deleteDelUserTx(txId);
                    }else revert("has pending txs yet! Please sign them first");
                    
                }

            }

    }
