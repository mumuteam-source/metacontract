1. TPN-01 | `validOwners` Array Mishandles Duplicate Elements
Medium
Recommendation
To maintain the integrity of other functionalities, it's advisable to conduct a duplicate check when adding new elements to an array. The team can use the '_validOwners[_owner]' to check if this '_owner' is already a valid owner.
Modifiedï¼š
We add a check in the addOwner and removeOwner for the user is already a valid user or not when adding or removeing
in the addOwner:

we add this check:

 require(_validOwners[_owner]!=1,"This Owner Already a Valid Owner!");

in the removeOwner:

we add this check:

     require(_validOwners[_owner]==1,"This Owner Not a Valid Owner!");
