1 CTN-01 | Incorrect Timestamp Difference Applied
Medium
Recommendation
It is recommended to employ a clearer representation, such as "24 hours," to denote the time interval.
Modified:
added "Hours" after the time duration;

CTN-02 | Wrong Visibility of `addSetTransaction`
Medium
Recommendation
It is recommended to adjust the visibility of the addSetTransaction() function appropriately to mitigate potential risks.
Modified:
change the public to private of function addSetTransaction();

CTN-03 | Unused Variables In `Transaction` Structure
Optimization
Recommendation
We recommend the team clean the unused code.
Modified:
we remove the unused parameters ( locked_, nodeCount_ and mintPrice_) of Struct Transaction.

CTP-05 | Potential Optimization to Multi-Sign Mechanism
Optimization
we Optimize the setSalesAddress function as the addOwner/removeOwner and setParameters;
but we do not remove these functions, as we should use them to manage the parameters on-chain;
and our dapp is developed for users, but not for managers, so we need these functions.
