4.  * MCI-16 | Unclaimed Tokens Can Be Withdrawn by `withdrawAddress`
Minor
Modified
The the change of investedAmount[investCoinAddress] in the withdraw function 
is deleted. protect time ended, this Amount should be not changed. 
so could caculate a correct number of unclaimed project coins.

5. MCD-02 | Absence of Time Lock in `signUserAdd()` and `signUserDel()` Functions
Discussion
Answer:
Adding/Deleting validOwner is working for multi-sign to weak the centralization risk of the owner.
Any valid owner can do NOTHING without MIN_SIGNATURES accounts have signed the tranaction.
And the valid owners can only add,delete, espencially, set withdraw address.
although add or remove valie owner execute immediately, but any of these valid owners 
would be multi-signed, so, this two functions need NOT the timelock.
