Discussion
Modified: 
We pass the stakeTokenAddress from the parameter of Constuct function like this:
constructor (address _stakeTokenAddress)
    {    
        require(_stakeTokenAddress != address(0), "StakeTokenAddress cannot be the zero address");
        stakeTokenAddress = _stakeTokenAddress;
    }
