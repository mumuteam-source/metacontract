1. MTS-03 | Discussion on Potential Unintended Max Pending Time
Discussion
Answer:
Some times, a valid owner agree the multi-sign, but forget to sign it, we can inform him
within 96 hours after the last sign transaction.
But if we do not change the transaction.timestamp each sign, there was a 3*24 = 72 hours time frame validation,and a 24 hours 
observationPeriod. If there is 2 valid owner signed, and the last valid owner forgot to sign, there are only 24 hours left.
So we use the timestamp refresh mechanism on each signature. 
The 96 hours max-waiting is after the last sign but not reaching the minimum required signatures.

2. MTS-02 | Potential Inconsistent Permission Restrictions
Informational
Modified:
We changed the functions such as deleteAddUserTx, deleteDelUserTx, deleteTransaction, deleteMaxPendingTx as private and do not
check the valid onwer by omit the validOwner modifier. 
add the executeTransaction as an validOwner function.
which in order to make sure the functions can be called consistency.
